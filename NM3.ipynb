                  "- Osteoarthritis: Common among older adults, it is a degenerative joint disease that causes the cartilage in the knee joint to wear down, leading to pain, swelling, and stiffness.\n",
                  "- Meniscus Tear: Damage to the meniscus, which is the cartilage in the knee that acts as a shock absorber, can cause pain, especially with twisting or bending movements.\n",
                  "- Patellar Tendonitis: Inflammation of the patellar tendon, which connects the kneecap to the shinbone, may cause pain just below the knee.\n",
                  "- Ligament Sprains: Injuries to the ligaments that stabilize the knee joint can lead to pain, swelling, and difficulty moving the knee.\n",

                  "- Refractive Errors: Conditions like nearsightedness (myopia), farsightedness (hyperopia), or astigmatism can cause blurred vision and may require glasses or contact lenses for correction.\n",
                  "- Age-Related Macular Degeneration: A common cause of vision loss in older adults, AMD damages the central part of the retina (the macula), which is responsible for sharp, central vision.\n",
                  "- Cataracts: A clouding of the lens inside the eye, cataracts can cause gradual blurring of vision, difficulty seeing in bright light, and sensitivity to glare.\n",
                  "- Glaucoma: This group of eye conditions damages the optic nerve, often caused by increased pressure within the eye. Symptoms may include blurred vision, tunnel vision, and halos around lights.\n",

                  "3. Ear Issues:\n",
                  "- Earwax Buildup: Excessive earwax (cerumen) can lead to hearing loss and tinnitus (ringing in the ears).\n",
                  "- Otitis Media: This inflammation of the middle ear often occurs when fluid builds up behind the eardrum, causing pain, pressure, and muffle hearing.\n",

These messages indicate that some Republican lawmakers were aware of, and in some cases discussed, Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election results, contrary to their public responses at the time. The messages suggest that several members of the House Freedom Caucus, led by Rep. Andy Biggs, were actively planning to object to electoral votes on January 6, 2021, contrary to their initial claims. Additionally, the texts show how Trump and Meadows sought to get then vice-president Mike Pence in their plan to challenge the election results.
